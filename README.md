# Haufe Challenge

The Haufe Challenge is an application that utilizes the Rick and Morty API to create a platform where users must log in to access its features. Once logged in, users can browse a list of characters from the Rick and Morty universe. They can add characters to their favorites list, search for characters by name, load more pages of characters (as the list is paginated), and sort characters alphabetically.
